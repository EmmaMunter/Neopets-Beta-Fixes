# The fixes
### Always show sidebar
##### always-show-sidebar.style
This fix makes sure the left sidebar is always shown, instead of having to click on the icon in the left top corner.

### Quickstock link
##### quickstock-link.user.js
This fix adds a link to the old quickstock page to the inventory.

### Show pet backgrounds
##### show-pet-backgrounds.user.js
This fix shows the background customizations of your pets in the "My Pets" view.
(It also makes the pet look a bit smaller though.)

# How to install
## .user.css files
Add the Stylus extension (or any other userstyles extension) to your browser. To install to fix, select the .user.css file, and click the "Raw" button. It should then open in Stylus where you can click the install button.

(Alternatively, click "import" in the Stylus manager, and paste the contents of the file.)

## .user.js files
Add a userscript extension like Tampermonkey (or Greasemonkey) to your browser. To install the fix, select the .user.js file, and click the "Raw" button. It should then open in Tampermonkey where you can click the install button.

(Alternatively, create a new script, and paste the contents of the file)
